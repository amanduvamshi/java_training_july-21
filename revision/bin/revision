1.conditional statements:
   1. if , if else , if else if , if else if else , switch case
2.looping :
    do while , while , for
    
3.Access Modifiers 4: private , no keyword for default, protected, public   
 
4.static: 
     static variables , static blocks, sttaic methods.
     flow : static variables and static block execution flow - top to bottom next main method.
5.non static:
      non static variables, non static blocks, constructors, non static methods , Object, this
      non static variables and blocks flow - top to bottom 
      constructor flow : based on the type of object we create.
      
      
 What happens at the time of object creation:
      
       first it executes non static varibles and non static block then constructor.
       
6.OOPS:
   1.Encapsulation : To get control on data( achieving using access modifiers )
        private variables and public methods.
   2.abstraction : Take out unnecessary details and only focus on aspects that are necessary 
                    to that context    
            interfaces pure abstract method, but from java 8 default methods.
            abstract at class level is abstract class
            abstract at method level is abstract method, we can't create abstract method on concrete class.
    3.Inheritence : super class feature using in sub class
                    extends , implements
                    is-a , has-a
    4. Polymerphism : Compile time polymerphism , Run time polymerphism.
 
 7.Exception Handling: 
                      try, catch , finally, throw , throws
                      Throwable --> sub classes--> Exception , Error
                          * Exception -- > Checked Exception(99% method callings)
                                     Runtime Exception (logical Errors)
                           * Error    --> Physical resources.
                           
8. Multi Threading : 
                   Two ways we can implement using extends Thread , implements Runnable
                   override run method
                   synchronized method or block , join , sleep, yield,wait, notify , notifyAll
                   
9. Collections     :  Collection<E>                           
                      Vector(legacy and sync)  ArrayList , LinkedList   
                      Map<K,V>
                        Hashtable(legacy and sync), HashMap , LinkedHashMap
                        keys should not be duplicate (equals and hashcode method)
                        
                       Set<K> : duplicats not allow
                       
                       Sorted Map   : TreeMap is a sub class of SortedMap
                                      Comparable and Comparator must override for custom class to enable sort.                        
                                                        
                                    
                                      
 10. String , StringBuffer, StringBuilder : practice all methods.
