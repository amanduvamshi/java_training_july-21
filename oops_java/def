Encapsulation : It's mechanism for restricting direct access to some of an object’s components.

Why restricting: To get control on data.

How can we achieve Encapsulation : By using Access Modifiers(private variables and public methods).


What is abstraction: We take out unnecessary details and only focus on aspects that are necessary 
to that context or system under consideration.
